###What is the difference between Hibernate and Spring Data JPA?
    These are 3 different things:
    JPA: Java persistence api which provide specification for persisting, reading, managing data from your java object to relations in database.
    Hibernate: There are various provider which implement jpa. Hibernate is one of them. So we have other provider as well. But if using jpa with spring it allows you to switch to different providers in future.
    Spring Data JPA: This is another layer on top of jpa which spring provide to make your life easy.
